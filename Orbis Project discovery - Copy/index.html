          <p>College-wide, DMACC is undertaking a significant effort to better understand the issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion in order to make changes that will improve the DMACC experience for all students and specifically those students who identify as part of a traditionally marginalized group. I am part of a sub-committee working on student engagement. We are looking at it in three phases - Prospective Students, Current Students, and Alumni Students. We would like to better understand how prospective students see DMACC from a diversity, equity, and inclusion lens and also work to improve student engagement with this in mind.

I'd like to propose that the next project be an evaluation of DMACC's website and those of other colleges and universities that they are interested in. What do the student's like/dislike about the DMACC website. What website categories are most important to them? What visuals interest them? How can the DMACC website be a better resource to them?

          Screen reader support enabled.I have an 82 year old client, Jon Cloyd Sr., who has an online business.  I created a Shopify website (https://covers-buckles-more.com) and business Facebook page for him to market his goods.  I did all of this at no charge, as he could not afford to pay me.  Everything is pretty much set up.  He needs help with updating his Shopify website and processing orders.  He also needs someone who can post to his Facebook page and also boost posts.  There may be an opportunity to also set up an Etsy shop for him.  He is a very sweet gentleman.  Once we identify who can help him, we can all three meet and I can handover the project.
